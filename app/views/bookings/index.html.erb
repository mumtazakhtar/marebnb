<%# Dashboard ideas: show bookings fist, then show horses when current user is owner %>

<div class="container mt-3">
  <h1>Bookings</h1>
  <p>
  Here you can find an overview of your bookings.
  Click on the horse's photo to visit their profile. <BR><BR>
  Can you image how excited the horse is for their stay? We're sure they simply can't wait!
  This is why it is unfortunately not possible to cancel your booking after confirmation.
  We don't wanna dissapoint the horses, do we?
  However, after a booking is confirmed,
  you can still change the dates through the edit button that will now appear at the bottom of your booking. <BR><BR>
